	Hi, I am Chuanyu Xue
</h3>
<p>
	I am now a pre-final year student in Qingdao University, and I am looking for&nbsp;<span>overseas</span> PhD position(North America prefered) and domestic&nbsp;intern job opportunity in 2020. My research interests include data mining and recommender systems, and I have participated in some data mining competitions and published some articles during my study. I was an independent musician before who played guitar for a popular folk band in China. My favorite language is Python. I also like playing League of Legends with my friends and watching movies with my GF.  Notely, if you are using WeChat brower, please click 原网页 to ensure your normal visiting&nbsp;
